# ESH
### the electronics shell

## Purpose
I normally use the python3 command line as a general purpose calculator when
I am working on my electrical engineering homework. 
This project is an attempt to make that a bit nicer with electrical engineering
things such as a parallel operator (||) and magnitude shortcuts i.e 10k = 10000.
